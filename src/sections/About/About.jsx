          <h2>On my Developer Journey</h2>
          <p>
            I've explored a lot of different industries before landing on
            software development, from television and marketing to hospitality
            and more. I've always been someone who focuses on growth and
            learning, and I'm excited to have finally found a field where the
            limits for this seem endless.
            <br />
            <br />A year ago, I took my first real step into tech with an online
            Frontend Developer course from Meta. Finishing that course only
            fueled my curiosity further, leading me to enroll in a Full-Stack
            Development bootcamp. The experience has been quite a whirlwind,
            throwing me headfirst into the developer world.
            <br />
            <br />I won't sugarcoat it, there have been moments when I felt like
            tossing my laptop (or myself) out the window. But the challenges
            have been worth it! The progress I've made in just a few months,
            often spending over 11 hours a day coding, has been immensely
            rewarding. Now, I'm excited to apply my skills in a developer role
            where I can continue to grow and learn in a field with endless
            opportunities.
